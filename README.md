========

###Track hands and fingers with sub millimeter accuracy and read user gestures.

The MakerHub Interface for Leap Motion Controller provides an easy-to-use LabVIEW API for the Leap Motion Controller. This library includes high-level VIs for accessing the position and velocity of points and hands as well as VIs to read gestures such as swipe, screen tap, key tap, and circles. The MakerHub Interface for Leap Motion Controller also makes it easy to read raw frame data including all roll, pitch, yaw, velocity, and position for every point, hand, or gesture in the frame.
